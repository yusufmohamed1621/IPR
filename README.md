# IPR
**IPR.exe is a program that helps you use different ways to calculate Inflow performance relationship based on stabilized well test data and investigate this relationship between flow rate & bottom hole flowing pressure / drawdown all what you need is a handful amount of data which appears in sequence in input menu which are (average reservoir pressure , bubble point pressure , Stabilized well test flowrate , stabilized well test BHFP and  finally the number of data points in order to build this IPR)

##Program capabilities :
The program has many different capabilities that you could benefit from easily such as :
1. Determining reservoir Type & recommended IPR method if you want.
2. calculating IPR using different methods such as well PI , Vogel's , Composite IPR.
3. based on conditions and given data and situation the program can pick a recommended method from them to use.
4. Predicting future IPR performance using fetkovich approximation method using given predicted future Reservoir pressure. 
5. Comparing present and future IPR performance.
6. The program can estimate (in every IPR method provided) the required drawdown required to achieve a desired production flowrate (if acceptable.) and that can help engineers in designing artificial lift systems for example like ESPs, etc..
7. The program can estimate the productivity index above bubble point pressure.
8. The program can calculate precisely the flowrate available  for any given drawdown (BHFP) for every IPR method available.
9. You can navigate the program easily back and forth between menus just follow the instructions and type the desired number.
10. you can change the input data for recalculation.

**N.B :When starting the program , press any key(s) to proceed except for x which will terminate the program instantaneously , you can also terminate the program easily and instantaneously from the Main menu just navigate there and press 8.
